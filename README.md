I am learning web development on Udemy 
all of these files are waht I leanred or what I am currently leanring on Udemy with Colt Steele's full Web developer bootcamp!!

If your hesitating on buying the course here is my personal opnion on the course:
- When you first buy it the first 20 ish vidoes you dont really learn anything after those 20ish videos you actually get to code in HTML
- HTML is actually very easy to understand and will only take you 2-3 days to complete
- CSS is kinda scary in my opinion if im being honest here CSS was very hard for me to understand but I know the basics
- Bootstrap is SO fun I think you might actually enjoy the boostrap part of css

  I haven't learned JS yet but I'll keep you guys updated with daily updates!
  If you need helo please contact me @weunhed on discord or Instagram!!
  Ps. I forgot to save the pricing panel! so sorry
